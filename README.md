# QST_with_MLE_Pauli_measurements

Implementation of Maximum-Likelihood Quantum State Tomography with Pauli measurements for $L$ qubits.

This repository provides a Python implementation of Quantum State Tomography (QST) using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Pauli measurement operators. The code focuses on reconstructing a quantum state's density matrix from simulated measurement data. Key functionalities include Pauli operator generation, measurement simulation, density matrix reconstruction, and validation metrics.
